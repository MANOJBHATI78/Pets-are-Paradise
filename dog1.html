                    Belly rub is one of the most sensitive and playful opportunities for a dog to gain all the attention of its pet parents. Sometimes they stick with <br> you like glue and follow wherever you go. The belly part of a dog’s body is extremely fragile, they do not unleash it until they trust you. The <br> topic is as delicate as it is interesting. Honestly, they deserve it, but it might be a sign of something else. Your dog might want to initiate something new that is meant just for both of you. But what to do? How to pursue it when you can’t hear it? Is it OK to rub a dog's belly? Check for the signs in your furry, whether they cling and follow you or are they rolling away from you? <br><br><br>
                    Learn small behaviours of your furry and start acting fast because you might never know, but they stop showing their jolliness in front of you when they see you aren’t reacting much. <br><br><br>
                    Learn their smallest reactions; start noticing them and react because if they see you not reacting, they will end up losing that expression.<br><br><br>
                    Offer them a belly rub, if they seem to enjoy it. Talk and let your furries know that you love giving them a belly rub and that too more than often because they love receiving it. Avoid giving them surprises, let them come to you for it because you never know that it could be a roll of suppression. We all understand how our dogs are attention seekers. Physical touch helps in developing a whole new level of affection and subsides with socialisation.

                    Why Do Dogs Like Belly Rubs So Much?
                </div>
                <div class="subhead">
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you pursue it, furries love it because it helps in stimulating a satisfying sensation in their hair follicles because of the presence of neurons that lights up their brain, causing a sensation. It indicates that they want this rubbing for a longer time. </li><br><br>
                        <li>Pronouncing them with some positive feedback such as “good dog”, psychologically makes them feel loved even more, so they enjoy it.</li><br>
                        <br>
                        <li>While rubbing their belly, never skip eye contact because it releases oxytocin, a hormonal response in both of you that helps in expressing an utmost attachment. In other words, it is a “love chemical”. </li><br><br>
                        <li>You might notice that sometimes while rubbing their belly, their leg kicks. Have you ever wondered, why do dogs kick when you rub their belly? Well, yes, it’s a tickle, our furries are ticklish. The nerves present are linked directly to their spinal cord which activates as a response moreover, it is a reflex. </li>
                    </ul>

                    Do dogs roll over for belly rubs?

                </div>
                <div class="par">
                    <p1>Oh hey, aww, my dog’s rolling, see that’s an intense reaction on their face, I don’t know what to do. Oh wait, the all-time solution is the belly rub, my dog loves it. I will get on with it. </p1>
                </div>
                <div class="head3">
                    <h1>ATTENTION!!!</h1>
                    <p1>Lack of knowledge can invite trouble. Every time your dog rolls, they don’t need a rub. Check their expressions; are they communicating an invitation? Rolling doesn’t always indicate a demand for a belly rub. When your dog isn’t close to you and rolls, their intense expressions can lead you to a conclusion that they aren’t in a jolly mood and that the state of rolling means Submission. They are afraid to handle something or other dogs to be precise. Therefore this behaviour indicates that they are stepping down. And when you proceed for a belly rub at this time, it might lead to a negative impression over them & they might not feel jolly about your actions. Don’t worry, give them time because their tummy is the most vulnerable part of their body and they won’t let anyone rub them unless they trust them.<br><br>
                        However, if they trust you enough, they will roll over close to you and won’t mind a belly rub. It indicates an agreement or a promising bond with their hooman. Offer a warm belly rub, they will enjoy it. <br><br>

                        Identify their depth of expressions.<br><br>
                        
                        A dog who agrees will show you some behavioural responses. Then it is up to you to identify those expressions and react accordingly. Identify these signs in a furry who seeks a belly rub from you: </p1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Relaxed or floppy mood </li>
                            <li>Loose and wiggly posture</li>
                            <li>Huge eyes</li>
                            <li>A relaxed and wagging tail </li>
                            <li>Smooth and subtle vocal sound </li>
                            <li>Appears comfortable with the company around </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p2>We are sure that you won’t miss these signs or indications because these express loudly what they want. And if you listen to them, you will be able to improve your bond with your furry. There will be times when these indications will be mixed and conflicting. Always take the high road, leave your furry for some time and notice their behaviour, do they come straight at you in a jolly and playful mood or do they step away. Don’t worry if they step away, they need some space & not all furries enjoy the belly rub. No big deal!<br><br>

                            Let them make a move and come to you whenever they feel ready. <br><br>
                            
                            If they want something from us, they will never hesitate to tell you that & you will be able to understand them. <br><br>
                            
                            There is a lot that’s going on in their head, just like us. So, give your detective brain a rest because this behaviour is normal. Don’t you feel irritated at someone and love them the next day? It’s the same expression. They need their space & they will catch up. <br><br>
                            
                            Now that you understand the two sides of rolling behaviour, it will become much easier for you to pet your furry. They seek a constant physical touch from their parents because that makes them feel homely. There is never a wrong time for petting. It’s just about leaving no loose ends. Here are the quick steps that will help you understand how to rub a dog's tummy:<br><br>
                            </p2>
                            <ul2>
                               <li> Keep your hands and fingers relaxed</li>
<li>Start rubbing the belly, stretch your palms and stick your fingernails smoothly and move in a circular motion</li>
<li>Stop and notice their reaction</li>
<li>If they like it, they will communicate that with you by moving their paws and staying still</li> 
<li>Go back and forth if they want more</li>
<li>Move your hands in all the directions & you might unlock one of the best belly rub techniques</li><br><br>

                            </ul2>
                            <p3>Focus on understanding what your furry wants, respect their response and start again. That will be your way out and your furry’s way into your heart. Keep your arms and eyes open and always try to identify the signs. Belly rubs are one of the stress busters for them, give them that and you both are good to go.</p3><br><br><br>
